# Fashion-Recogniton

Fashion classification, in particular, aims to identify categories of clothing items, and this appeals to emerging applications, such as e-commerce, computer-aided fashion design, social media, and video surveillance. In this project, the Fashion MNIST and DeepFashion data sets are used as the basis for training and developing deep convolutional neural networks for fashion clothing classification. The trained deep networks are then used to implement a real-time clothing recognition system.
